# TicTacToe
Android app by Ryan Lake and Jess Boerner

Developed on android studio

Additions:

CPU player with two brains, one chooses randomly and the other tries to block the player but can be outsmarted.

Undo move option to undo last move

Hint option to show what the CPU would do if in the player's position



Since for the 3rd project we plan to expand this into an inception tic-tac-toe game, we will probably create a 3rd CPU brain that is very difficult to beat.
