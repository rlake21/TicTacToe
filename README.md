# TicTacToe
Android app by Ryan Lake and Jess Boerner

Developed on android studio

Additions:

CPU player with two brains, one chooses randomly and the other tries to block the player but can be outsmarted.

Player wins counter, changes for player vs player and player vs computer

Turn and other information prompter

Undo move option to undo last move

Hint option to show what the CPU would do if in the player's position

Home menu screen activity and layout for one player (segues to difficulty screen), two player and exit game

Difficulty screen activity and layout for 0, 1 and future 2 (disabled) cpu difficulties and back button

New Game and Exit Game menu options in game

Changed app launcher icon to tic-tac-toe board



Since for the 3rd project we plan to expand this into an inception tic-tac-toe game, we will probably create a 3rd CPU brain that is very difficult to beat.
